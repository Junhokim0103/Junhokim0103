👋 Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m Junho Kim — a system-level embedded engineer passionate about designing end-to-end hardware and firmware systems.
I build robust embedded platforms that tightly integrate real-time motor control, wireless communication, and Linux-based UI applications.

💡 About Me

🔧 Embedded System Engineer with 8+ years of experience

🧠 Skilled in MCU/MPU board design, firmware (RTOS/Baremetal), and system architecture

⚙️ Real-world experience with stepper, brushed, BLDC motor control, various sensors

📡 Familiar with BLE, Wi-Fi, CAN, and low-level Ethernet protocols

🖥️ Proficient with Qt GUI development on embedded Linux

🧾 Experience in STM32, nRF52, Zephyr, FreeRTOS, and Yocto/Buildroot

🛠️ Can design custom boards using STM32MP1/MP2 and work with DRAM interfaces

🛠️ What I Can Do

🔲 Embedded Hardware Design

Schematic design (MCU/MPU, DRAM, power tree, PMIC, sensors)

3-phase motor driver circuits with gate driver flexibility

BLE/Wi-Fi RF layout and 50Ω impedance matching

📟 Firmware Development

Real-time control (6-step BLDC, FOC with STM32 MCSDK)

Distance-based stepper motor control with motion profiling

BLE communication stacks, UART/SPI/I2C peripheral drivers

🧩 System Integration

Qt-based HMI for embedded Linux devices

Device tree, kernel config, and driver debugging (STM32MPx)

Protocol bridge (e.g., CAN ↔ Ethernet, BLE ↔ UART)

📘 Software Engineering

Clean C/C++ architecture with HAL/LL API

Python automation tools for simulation/log analysis

Git, CMake, VSCode, SEGGER Embedded Studio

🌱 What I'm Exploring

Industrial wireless protocols (real-time EtherCAT over Wi-Fi)

AI-integrated embedded systems (edge inference + robotics)

ROS2 and Isaac ROS for intelligent control systems

Porting Linux BSP on STM32MP2 and performance tuning
